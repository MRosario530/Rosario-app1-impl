 * Adding to the list.

## Documentation and Capabilities

This To Do List Application is capable of handling a list of at least 100 items, 
each containing a description between 1 and 256 characters, an optional due date in 
YYYY-MM-DD format, and an indication of whether or not the item is complete.

### Adding Items to the List

To add an item to the list, navigate to the left side of the program, beneath the "Add
New Item" header. From there you must input a description into the text box between 1 and 
256 characters. Anything outside of that range will display an error message. To add a due 
date to the item, select the small calendar beneath the description text box and choose a
date. A date is not required. To add the item to the list, simply press the "Add Item to List"
button beneath the calendar.

### Removing Items from the List

To remove an item from the list, first select the item you wish to remove within the table
at the center of the application. Then at the bottom of the screen, there is a "Delete 
Selected Item" button that when pressed, will delete the selected item from the list.

### Clear All Items from the List

To clear the entire list, press the button at the bottom of the screen that says "Clear List".

### Editing the Contents of an Item

To edit the contents of an item, first select the item on the table at the center of the 
screen. On the right hand side of the screen, there are a set of input boxes on beneath 
the "Edit Current Item" header that enable you to edit all components of an item.

* To edit a description simply type your new description into the large text box. Leaving the box blank results in no changes to the description.
* To edit the due date choose a new date from the calendar beneath the large text box. Leaving the box blank prevents any changes to the due date. If you wish to remove a due date entirely, press the "Mark to Clear Date Entirely" checkbox.
* To mark an item as complete or incomplete, simply toggle the "Complete?" checkbox beneath the calendar.

To save changes press the "Edit Selected Item" button.

### Displaying All Items in the List

To display all items currently within the list, navigate above the table to the 3 buttons
and select the "Display All" button. This is the initial setting of the application.

### Displaying Incomplete Items in the List

To display incomplete items currently within the list, navigate above the table to the 3 buttons
and select the "Display Incomplete" button.

### Displaying Complete Items in the List

To display complete items currently within the list, navigate above the table to the 3 buttons
and select the "Display Complete" button.

### Saving the List to Your PC

This application comes with the ability to save and reopen lists at a later date. In order 
to save the current list, navigate beneath the table to the button with the arrow pointing 
down. Pressing this button will open a file window so that you can choose where to save your 
file.

### Loading a Previously Saved List from Your PC

In order to open a previously saved list on your PC, navigate beneath the table to the button 
with the arrow pointing downwards. Pressing this button will open a file window so that you
can select and open a previous list. This will overwrite your current list!
